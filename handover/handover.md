# Technical Considerations

* Sharing is important - need proper routing for that to work

Pure AngularJS using directives and mousedown, mouseup and mouseover events
* very limited functionality

codef0rmer: jQuery drag and drop made easy in AngularJs

* still a bit limited

interactjs
* drag and drop
* resizing
* multi-touch gestures
* snapping/grid
* excellent documentation
