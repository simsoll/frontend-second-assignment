            SQUARES is a digital playground for everyone, where users rearrange the work of digital designers to fit their own individuality.
        </p>
        <p>
            On SQUARES users create their own custom artworks from square set that visitors can play around with and put together via
            a digital interface. SQUARES is an open art playground where you can purchase printed
            versions of the artists' works reworked into your particular personal design. SQUARES is a global, user-driven
            and interactive gallery where people from around the globe can dive into the artworks and create works that fit
            their expression and experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time SQUARES is a fascinating and imaginative business concept that attracts artists, both because of the initial
            challenge to their creativity and because they can sell and profit from their work.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea behind SQUARES is developed by Esben Kjær Ravn, CEO and Founder of <a href="http://www.kongorange.com/">Kong Orange</a>.
