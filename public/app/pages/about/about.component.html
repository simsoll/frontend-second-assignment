        SQUARES is a digital playground for everyone, where users rearrange the work of digital designers to fit their own individuality.
    </p>
    <p>
        On SQUARES users create their own custom artworks from square set that visitors can play around with and put together via
        <a ng-link="['Create']">a digital interface</a>. SQUARES is an open art playground where you can purchase
        printed versions of the artists' works reworked into your particular personal design. SQUARES is a global, user-driven
        and interactive gallery where people from around the globe can dive into the artworks and create works that fit their
        expression and experience.

        At the same time SQUARES is a fascinating and imaginative business concept that attracts artists, both because of the initial
        challenge to their creativity and because they can sell and profit from their work.

        The idea behind SQUARES is developed by Esben Kj√¶r Ravn, CEO and Founder of <a href="http://www.kongorange.com/">Kong Orange</a>.
